# Spiking Variablity

Spike activity of neurons is not deterministic. For instance, each time we present the same stimulus there would be a significant variablity in the recorded activity of the neuron over time. This stochastic behavior in spike activity have improtant consequences including functional ones. For example the amount of sensory information that can encoded by a single neuron or a population of neurons in propotional to response variablity.
